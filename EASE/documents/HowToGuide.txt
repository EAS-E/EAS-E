Note: This guide assumes some knowledge of EAS-E concepts.

Subdirectory EASE/tools contains two executables: EASEdevelop and EASEtranslate.

The first provides a GUI which supports definition of entities and procedures.
Project->Open offers a folder selection of examples (see config.dat).
Output is saved in XML file(s), then 'translated' to C source code.
Running tools/EASEtranslate on the selected folder accomplishes this.
(EASEtranslate is silent - just wait for it to complete; it notifies of any errors.)
A listing file and possible error file are generated in the target folder.

Config.dat specifies the initial folder for project selection; this can be edited.
It also specifies a link to a folder for system data.

At this time, these C files are intended to be built in VisualStudio projects.
Projects corresponding to the examples projects are located in EASE/VSprojects.

A project.eas file exists in each EAS-E source folder.
The first line specifies the target folder for the generated C files.
The remaining line(s) list the XML file(s) which constitute the project.

As delivered, each VS source code folder includes duplicated library .h and .cpp files.
Running the included linklib.bat file will establish symbolic links to the master copies.

Selecting Project->New in EASEdevelop creates a folder for the new project.
This will contain a basic XML file, .eas project file and a default folder for C code.
Edit the .eas file as needed to add project .XML files or change the target folder.
A suitable VS project must be created for a new project - this is non-trivial.
